- INSTALLING ON RASPBERRY PI.
 -- These instructions are based on 2015-02-16-raspbian-wheezy.
 -- Minimum 16Gb SD card will be needed. In future might need even more space, plan accordingly.
 -- Download and read instructions here: http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 1. Install wheezy on SD card using method that's available to you.
        Boot Raspberry PI and connect to HDMI monitor and usb keyboard.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 2. You will see rasp-config application, please choose the following options:

1. Expand filesystem -> YES
2. Change user password -> Whatever you want
3. Enable Boot ->  Choose first option -> Console Text console
8. Advanced Options
	A3. Memory split -> 16
	A4. SSH -> Enabled
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 3. Choose finish and reboot Rasp PI
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 4. Connect by SSH or through Terminal. Enter username: pi and password that you have setup in Step 2-> Option 2

( You must be connected to internet through Ethernet port! )

Execute these commands:
git clone https://github.com/kotl/CSFirstOffline.git cs
cd cs/scripts
sudo ./run_all

This will take very long time (from several hours to a day). Keep internet connected!
Downloading step takes particularly long. 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Step 5. Configure router for local DNS redirection.

- Raspberry PI must be connected into a network which has DHCP server running (on local wired or wireless router).
  PI should be setup to always receive the same IP address in the network (setup this on the router in static DHCP
  section). You can find MAC address (HWaddr) by running 'ifconfig -v eth0' in the terminal of Rasp PI.
  Also, router must run DNSMasq service that will forward all DNS requests to Rasp PI. This is important, otherwise
  fake DNS entries won't work. To get configuration required to be used in DNSMasq, point browser of your client
  computer connected into this local network to the address of Rasp PI, like this:
    http://192.168.30.2/scratch/dns.php  
    ( where 192.168.30.2 is address of Rasp PI )
    Copy resulting page into DNSMasq configuration in the router and reboot router.

- Point your browser to admin interface at http://scratch.mit.edu/admin.php 
  If it works - you are now ready to start your classes! Make sure you understand
  how to login to this admin interface as you will need to use it from class to class.

- Do not use this router to access internet -> sites that are redirected in DNSMasq configuration
  will still get redirected.

- Updates steps below can be repeated as needed. Watch github repo for updates.

- Students should access CSFirst by going to http://www.cs-first.com and choosing appropriate lessons.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Getting updates:

The easiest thing to do is to execute run_all again.
It is recommended that you backup your SD card first, just in case.
(You can use WIN32Imager on Windows for example)

And don't forget to take Raspberry PI out of local router (that you modified with DNSMasq settings)
network and connect it to Internet to perform update steps. This is very important because
you may end up hitting the same Raspberry PI unit because of DNS redirection.


You can also run update steps individually:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Configure (this is only required if anything in CSFirstOffline submodules have changed.)
We will probably tag each repo that requires run of configure script.

Execute:
cd /home/pi/cs/scripts
sudo ./configure

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Download latest cs-first data:

Execute:
cd /home/pi/cs/scripts
sudo ./download

This can take very long time (i.e. from several hours to days, depending on your connection)

If Rasp PI gets rebooted, you can simply login and execute this command again. Prior progress won't be lost,
just make sure it is completely finished. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Adopt downloaded data for use:

Execute:
cd /home/pi/cs/scripts
sudo ./convert
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
